# The AID registry as an MPFS instance: the registry machine

Abstract model of the registry ruled by D-024 — one UTxO holding the MPF root
over every AID ever registered — built as a cage of cardano-mpfs-onchain on
the plugin path (cardano-foundation/cardano-mpfs-onchain#99), after the
rulings of 2026-09-02/03:

* the cage never interprets a leaf; the **leaf value** is the protocol's:
  `active token` while a checkpoint carries that token, `dormant k` when the
  checkpoint has left the chain and `k` is the key state a revival must
  rotate from, `convicted` for ever;
* **requests** are inbox UTxOs and never contend: a registration, a revival
  or a conviction of a dormant AID is posted by anyone with the evidence and
  a bond; a **go-request** (`goDormant k`, `goConvicted`) is created only by
  a *reap* of a bondless checkpoint, funded from that checkpoint's min-ADA,
  dated at the end of time so that it can never be retracted, and refused by
  the plugin for rejection so that `k` can never be lost;
* a **fold** is a permissionless `Modify`: anyone spends the registry at its
  current generation with a non-empty batch; the cage applies the leaf
  operation each request declares and the plugin admits it and mints or
  couples what the transition needs; a stale generation is refused with no
  state change; the plugin is pinned;
* **rotations, pauses, resumes and convictions of a live checkpoint never
  write the registry**: the indirection is the token, which survives every
  rotation; the checkpoint carries live, parked (bonds withdrawn) and
  tombstone;
* a **reap** (anyone) spends a parked checkpoint after the grace window, or
  earlier with the owner's keys, or a tombstone at once: it burns the token,
  keeps the min-ADA less the go-request as premium, and posts the go-request.

There is no close: a leaf, once inserted, is permanent.

No cryptography, no MPF: the root is the association list of leaves and the
absence proof is membership. The evidence a step needs is an `Env` of
decidable predicates standing for the checks the plugin, the checkpoint
policy and the observers perform. Key states are abstracted to a counter
advanced by every rotation. A functional `stepFn` is the one executable
source: the theorems are stated over it, the simulator transcribes it, and
the trace driver runs it.

DEC-364-STEPFN (frozen): `stepFn` and `processBody` are the sole executable
transition semantics; no inductive `Step` is added. The public
admission/refusal inversion surface is the twelve bidirectional `*_iff`
theorems (`stepFn_contribute_iff`, `stepFn_fold_iff`, `stepFn_retract_iff`,
`stepFn_reap_iff`, `stepFn_pause_iff`, `stepFn_resume_iff`,
`stepFn_convictCkpt_iff`, `processBody_register_iff`,
`processBody_revive_iff`, `processBody_goDormant_iff`,
`processBody_goConvicted_iff`, `processBody_convict_iff`). `ReachFar`
(stated over `stepFn` in `CardanoKeri.RegistryGoals`) is unchanged.
